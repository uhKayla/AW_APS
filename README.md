### Angel's Penetration System

A fully open-source implementation of Dynamic Penetration Shader systems. Compatible with DPS, TPS, and SPS, this is meant as an animation suite for those shaders, not as a replacement to them. 

To use this with SPS it is **highly recommended** you build an editor copy of your penetrator in order for it to work correctly. This will also reduce compile times.

This project has a hard dependency on [AW_OCS](https://github.com/uhKayla/AW_OCS), our Open Contact Standard, please use that package as well!

Requires NDMF ~~, Modular Avatar, and Animator as Code (with addons for NDMF, MA, and VRC).~~

### Current status:
Currently you can build animation contacts for penetrators and build everything to do with holes (sockets, whatever). Holes are currently manually placed on the avatar but auto-placement and easier access via serialized transforms is in the pipeline.

There is currently no automation of enable / disable animations, but this is planned as soon as we sort out dependency requirements.
