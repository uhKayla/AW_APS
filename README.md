### Angel's Penetration System

A fully open-source implementation of Dynamic Penetration Shader systems. Compatible with DPS, TPS, and SPS, this is meant as an animation suite for those shaders, not as a replacement to them. 

To use this with SPS it is **highly recommended** you build an editor copy of your penetrator in order for it to work correctly. This will also reduce compile times.
